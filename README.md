# What is Juan Validez

A bold, strong cup of JavaScript validations.

# What?

It's a validation library that is framework/library agnostic.  There is a default integration for jQuery, but you can also use it without.

Rules are written independently and can be injected at run time. The core ruleset is pretty small.

# Tests?

Yep.

# Usage?

See the examples directory.

# Writing my own rules?

See src/rules/lol.js and test/spec/rules/lol.js

No pull requests will be taken without tests. You add tests, and you are 99% likely to get pulled.

# License?

MIT IN THE HOUSE!
